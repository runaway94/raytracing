 *  The interpret function is called for repl-commands that are not handled by
 *  \ref repl directly. Return true if your algorithm accepted the command.
 *
 *  prepare_frame can be used to initialize things before a number of samples
 *  are rendered.
 *
 *  Note: This is still a little messy in that a few things should be moved out
 *  (see comment below) and that a few things (also from inside render_context)
 *  should go into recursive_algorithm (or cpu_rendering_context if we get to
 *  that).
